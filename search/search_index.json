In SQLite, the CREATE TABLE statement is used to define a new table and its structure. This section will guide you through the syntax and provide examples to help you understand how to create tables effectively. Syntax # The basic syntax for creating a table in SQLite is as follows: CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1_name column1_type column1_constraints, column2_name column2_type column2_constraints, ... ); table_name : The name of the table you want to create. column1_name, column2_name, ... : The names of the columns in the table. column1_type, column2_type, ... : The data types of the columns (e.g., INTEGER , TEXT , REAL , BLOB , etc.). column1_constraints, column2_constraints, ... : Optional constraints on the columns (e.g., PRIMARY KEY , NOT NULL , UNIQUE , FOREIGN KEY , etc.). Example # Let's create a simple table named users with the following columns: id : An integer that uniquely identifies each user and serves as the primary key. name : A text field that stores the user's name. email : A text field that stores the user's email address and must be unique. created_at : A datetime field that stores the date and time when the user was created. Here is the SQL statement to create the users table: CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); Explanation: id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY : Defines the id column as an integer and sets it as the primary key. name TEXT NOT NULL : Defines the name column as a text field that cannot be null. email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL : Defines the email column as a unique text field that cannot be null. created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP : Defines the created_at column as a datetime field with a default value of the current timestamp. More Complex Example # For a more complex example, let's create a products table with the following columns: ProductID : An integer that uniquely identifies each product and serves as the primary key. ProductName : A text field that stores the product's name. SupplierID : An integer that references the SupplierID in the suppliers table. CategoryID : An integer that references the CategoryID in the categories table. QuantityPerUnit : A text field that describes the quantity per unit. UnitPrice : A real number that represents the price per unit. UnitsInStock : An integer that represents the number of units in stock. UnitsOnOrder : An integer that represents the number of units on order. ReorderLevel : An integer that represents the reorder level. Discontinued : A boolean that indicates whether the product is discontinued. Here is the SQL statement to create the products table: CREATE TABLE products ( ProductID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, ProductName TEXT NOT NULL, SupplierID INTEGER, CategoryID INTEGER, QuantityPerUnit TEXT, UnitPrice REAL, UnitsInStock INTEGER, UnitsOnOrder INTEGER, ReorderLevel INTEGER, Discontinued INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (Discontinued IN (0, 1)), FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES suppliers(SupplierID), FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID) REFERENCES categories(CategoryID) ); Explanation: ProductID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY : Defines the ProductID column as an integer and sets it as the primary key. ProductName TEXT NOT NULL : Defines the ProductName column as a text field that cannot be null. SupplierID INTEGER : Defines the SupplierID column as an integer that references the SupplierID in the suppliers table. CategoryID INTEGER : Defines the CategoryID column as an integer that references the CategoryID in the categories table. QuantityPerUnit TEXT : Defines the QuantityPerUnit column as a text field. UnitPrice REAL : Defines the UnitPrice column as a real number. UnitsInStock INTEGER : Defines the UnitsInStock column as an integer. UnitsOnOrder INTEGER : Defines the UnitsOnOrder column as an integer. ReorderLevel INTEGER : Defines the ReorderLevel column as an integer. Discontinued INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (Discontinued IN (0, 1)) : Defines the Discontinued column as an integer that cannot be null, with a constraint to ensure the value is either 0 (false) or 1 (true). FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES suppliers(SupplierID) : Creates a foreign key constraint on the SupplierID column that references the SupplierID in the suppliers table. FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID) REFERENCES categories(CategoryID) : Creates a foreign key constraint on the CategoryID column that references the CategoryID in the categories table. Common Data Types # Here are some of the common data types you can use when creating tables in SQLite: INTEGER : A signed integer. REAL : A floating-point number. TEXT : A text string. BLOB : A binary large object. NUMERIC : Stores numeric values with an arbitrary precision. BOOLEAN : Stores a boolean value (0 or 1). DATETIME : Stores date and time information. Common Constraints # Here are some of the common constraints you can apply to columns in SQLite: PRIMARY KEY : Uniquely identifies each record in the table. NOT NULL : Ensures that the column cannot contain NULL values. UNIQUE : Ensures that all values in the column are unique. CHECK (condition) : Ensures that all values in the column satisfy the specified condition. DEFAULT value : Sets a default value for the column. FOREIGN KEY (column) REFERENCES other_table(other_column) : Creates a foreign key constraint. By understanding how to create tables and define their structure, you can effectively manage and organize your data in SQLite. Creating well-structured tables is the first step towards building a robust and efficient database.","title":"Creating Tables"},{"location":"05_basic/051_creating_tables.html#basic_sql_commands","text":"","title":"Basic SQL Commands"},{"location":"05_basic/051_creating_tables.html#creating_tables","text":"Creating tables is one of the fundamental operations when working with databases.

In SQLite, the INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records to a table. This section will guide you through the syntax and provide examples to help you understand how to insert data effectively. Syntax # The basic syntax for inserting data into a table in SQLite is as follows: INSERT INTO table_name (column1_name, column2_name, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...); table_name : The name of the table where you want to insert data. column1_name, column2_name, ... : The names of the columns where you want to insert values. value1, value2, ... : The values to be inserted into the specified columns. You can also insert data into all columns of a table without specifying the column names, as long as you provide values for all columns in the correct order: INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...); Example # Let's insert data into a simple table named users with the following columns: id , name , email , and created_at . Assuming the users table is created as follows: CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); To insert a new user into the users table: INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'); Explanation: - INSERT INTO users (name, email) : Specifies the users table and the name and email columns. - VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com') : Provides the values for the name and email columns. If you want to insert data into all columns, including the primary key: INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2024-01-01 10:00:00'); Explanation: - INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '2024-01-01 10:00:00') : Provides values for all columns in the correct order: id , name , email , and created_at . Inserting Multiple Rows # You can insert multiple rows in a single INSERT INTO statement by separating each row with a comma: INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com'), ('Bob Smith', 'bob.smith@example.com'), ('Carol White', 'carol.white@example.com'); More Complex Example # For a more complex example, let's insert data into the products table with the following columns: ProductID , ProductName , SupplierID , CategoryID , QuantityPerUnit , UnitPrice , UnitsInStock , UnitsOnOrder , ReorderLevel , and Discontinued . Assuming the products table is created as follows: CREATE TABLE products ( ProductID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, ProductName TEXT NOT NULL, SupplierID INTEGER, CategoryID INTEGER, QuantityPerUnit TEXT, UnitPrice REAL, UnitsInStock INTEGER, UnitsOnOrder INTEGER, ReorderLevel INTEGER, Discontinued INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (Discontinued IN (0, 1)), FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES suppliers(SupplierID), FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID) REFERENCES categories(CategoryID) ); To insert a new product into the products table: INSERT INTO products (ProductName, SupplierID, CategoryID, QuantityPerUnit, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock, UnitsOnOrder, ReorderLevel, Discontinued) VALUES ('Chai', 1, 1, '10 boxes x 20 bags', 18.00, 39, 0, 10, 0); Explanation: INSERT INTO products (ProductName, SupplierID, CategoryID, QuantityPerUnit, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock, UnitsOnOrder, ReorderLevel, Discontinued) : Specifies the products table and the columns to insert values into. VALUES ('Chai', 1, 1, '10 boxes x 20 bags', 18.00, 39, 0, 10, 0) : Provides the values for the specified columns. Inserting Data with Default Values # If a table column has a default value, you can omit that column from the INSERT INTO statement, and SQLite will use the default value. Assuming the users table has a created_at column with a default value: INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Eve Black', 'eve.black@example.com'); Explanation: Since created_at has a default value, it is not necessary to specify it in the INSERT INTO statement. SQLite will automatically set it to the current timestamp. Common Issues and Solutions # Unique Constraint Violation : If you try to insert a duplicate value into a column with a UNIQUE constraint, SQLite will raise an error. Solution: Ensure the values for UNIQUE columns are unique or handle the error using INSERT OR IGNORE . sql INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'); Not Null Constraint Violation : If you try to insert a null value into a column with a NOT NULL constraint, SQLite will raise an error. Solution: Provide non-null values for columns with NOT NULL constraints. Foreign Key Constraint Violation : If you try to insert a value into a column with a foreign key constraint that does not exist in the referenced table, SQLite will raise an error. Solution: Ensure the value exists in the referenced table or insert the referenced value first.

In SQLite, the SELECT statement is used to query data from one or more tables. This section will guide you through the syntax and provide examples to help you understand how to select data effectively. Syntax # The basic syntax for selecting data from a table in SQLite is as follows: SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]; column1_name, column2_name, ... : The names of the columns you want to retrieve. table_name : The name of the table from which to retrieve the data. condition : An optional condition to filter the rows returned by the query. ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC] : An optional clause to sort the results by one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order. Selecting All Columns # To select all columns from a table, use the asterisk (*) wildcard: SELECT * FROM table_name; Example : To select all columns from the users table: SELECT * FROM users; Selecting Specific Columns # To select specific columns from a table, list the column names separated by commas: SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ... FROM table_name; Example : To select the name and email columns from the users table: SELECT name, email FROM users; Using the WHERE Clause # The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows returned by the query based on a condition: SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition; Example : To select all users with the name 'John Doe': SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe'; Using the ORDER BY Clause # The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results of the query by one or more columns: SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]; Example : To select all users and order them by their name in ascending order: SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC; Using Aggregate Functions # SQLite supports various aggregate functions such as COUNT , SUM , AVG , MIN , and MAX to perform calculations on data: SELECT aggregate_function(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition; Example : To count the number of users in the users table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users; To find the average price of products in the products table: SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) FROM products; Grouping Data with GROUP BY # The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows: SELECT column1_name, aggregate_function(column2_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1_name; Example : To find the number of orders placed by each customer: SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID; Filtering Groups with HAVING # The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on a condition: SELECT column1_name, aggregate_function(column2_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1_name HAVING condition; Example : To find customers who have placed more than 5 orders: SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING COUNT(*) > 5; Joining Tables # To retrieve data from multiple tables, you can use various types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN): SELECT table1.column1_name, table2.column2_name, ... FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column; Example : To select order details along with product names: SELECT od.OrderID, p.ProductName, od.Quantity, od.UnitPrice FROM \"Order Details\" od JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID; Using Subqueries # A subquery is a query nested within another query. Subqueries can be used in various parts of the SQL statement: SELECT column1_name FROM table_name WHERE column2_name = (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition); Example : To select all users who placed an order with a total amount greater than $1000: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM orders WHERE total_amount > 1000); Example Workflow # To illustrate a typical workflow in selecting data, let's go through a simple example: Create a Database : sqlite3 example.db Create Tables : CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); CREATE TABLE orders ( OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INTEGER, OrderDate DATETIME, TotalAmount REAL, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES users(id) ); Insert Data : INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'); INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com'); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, '2024-01-01', 150.00); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, '2024-01-02', 200.00); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (2, '2024-01-03', 300.00); Select Data : SELECT * FROM users; SELECT name, email FROM users; SELECT * FROM orders WHERE TotalAmount > 150; SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders; SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID; SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; SELECT o.OrderID, u.name, o.TotalAmount FROM orders o JOIN users u ON o.CustomerID = u.id; By mastering the SELECT statement and its various clauses, you can effectively retrieve and analyze data stored in your SQLite database.

Each example will include the SQL input and the expected output, with LIMIT applied to shorten the outputs for readability. Additionally, each example is followed by a detailed explanation of the SQL syntax used. Updating Data # Update a single row # Input : UPDATE users SET email = 'john.newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1; Output : 1 row updated. Input : SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 LIMIT 1; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------- 1 | John Doe | john.newemail@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 Explanation : The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. The SET clause specifies the column to be updated and its new value. The WHERE clause filters the rows to be updated. In this example, the email column of the row where id is 1 is updated to 'john.newemail@example.com'. Update multiple rows # Input : UPDATE users SET email = 'updated@example.com' WHERE name LIKE 'Alice%'; Output : 1 row updated. Input : SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'Alice%' LIMIT 1; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------- 2 | Alice Johnson | updated@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:01:00 Explanation : The UPDATE statement with the WHERE clause can also be used to update multiple rows that meet a specific condition. The LIKE operator is used for pattern matching. In this example, all rows where the name starts with 'Alice' are updated to have the email set to 'updated@example.com'. Incrementing values # Input : UPDATE orders SET TotalAmount = TotalAmount + 50 WHERE TotalAmount < 300; Output : 2 rows updated. Input : SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 3; Output : OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | TotalAmount --------|------------|------------|------------- 1 | 1 | 2024-01-01 | 200.00 2 | 1 | 2024-01-02 | 250.00 3 | 2 | 2024-01-03 | 300.00 Explanation : The UPDATE statement can also be used to perform arithmetic operations on column values. In this example, the TotalAmount column is incremented by 50 for all rows where TotalAmount is less than 300. Deleting Data # Delete a single row # Input : DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1; Output : 1 row deleted. Input : SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------- 2 | Alice Johnson | alice.johnson@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:01:00 3 | Bob Smith | bob.smith@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:02:00 Explanation : The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table. The WHERE clause specifies which rows should be deleted. In this example, the row where id is 1 is deleted from the users table. Delete multiple rows # Input : DELETE FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'Bob%'; Output : 1 row deleted. Input : SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------- 2 | Alice Johnson | alice.johnson@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:01:00 Explanation : The DELETE statement can also be used to delete multiple rows that match a specific condition. In this example, all rows where the name starts with 'Bob' are deleted from the users table. Delete all rows in a table # Input : DELETE FROM orders; Output : 4 rows deleted. Input : SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 3; Output : OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | TotalAmount --------|------------|------------|------------- Note: The table is empty after the delete operation. Explanation : To delete all rows in a table without removing the table itself, the DELETE statement is used without a WHERE clause. In this example, all rows are deleted from the orders table. Using WHERE Clause # Select with WHERE clause # Input : SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe' LIMIT 1; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|----------|----------------------|-------------------------- 1 | John Doe | john.doe@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 Explanation : The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on a specified condition. In this example, the query selects all columns from the users table where the name is 'John Doe'. Update with WHERE clause # Input : UPDATE users SET email = 'john.newemail@example.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe'; Output : 1 row updated. Input : SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe' LIMIT 1; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------- 1 | John Doe | john.newemail@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 Explanation : The WHERE clause can also be used with the UPDATE statement to specify which rows should be updated. In this example, the email column is updated for all rows where the name is 'John Doe'. Delete with WHERE clause # Input : DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'Bob Smith'; Output : 1 row deleted.

By default, the sorting is in ascending order ( ASC ). In this example, the query selects all columns from the users table and sorts the results by the name column in ascending order. Sort by a single column in descending order # Input : SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name DESC LIMIT 3; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------- 1 | John Doe | john.doe@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 3 | Bob Smith | bob.smith@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:02:00 2 | Alice Johnson | alice.johnson@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:01:00 Explanation : To sort the results in descending order, the DESC keyword is used with the ORDER BY clause. In this example, the query selects all columns from the users table and sorts the results by the name column in descending order. Sort by multiple columns # Input : SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY CustomerID ASC, TotalAmount DESC LIMIT 3; Output : OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | TotalAmount --------|------------|------------|------------- 2 | 1 | 2024-01-02 | 200.00 1 | 1 | 2024-01-01 | 150.00 3 | 2 | 2024-01-03 | 300.00 Explanation : The ORDER BY clause can be used to sort the results by multiple columns. The sorting priority is from left to right. In this example, the query selects all columns from the orders table and sorts the results by CustomerID in ascending order and TotalAmount in descending order. Combine ORDER BY with WHERE clause # Input : SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%example.com' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3; Output : id | name | email | created_at ---|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------- 3 | Bob Smith | bob.smith@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:02:00 2 | Alice Johnson | alice.johnson@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:01:00 1 | John Doe | john.doe@example.com | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 Explanation : The ORDER BY clause can be combined with the WHERE clause to filter and sort the results. In this example, the query selects all columns from the users table where the email contains 'example.com' and sorts the results by the created_at column in descending order. Sort numeric values # Input : SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY TotalAmount ASC LIMIT 3; Output : OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | TotalAmount --------|------------|------------|------------- 1 | 1 | 2024-01-01 | 150.00 2 | 1 | 2024-01-02 | 200.00 3 | 2 | 2024-01-03 | 300.00 Input : SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY TotalAmount DESC LIMIT 3; Output : OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate | TotalAmount --------|------------|------------|------------- 4 | 3 | 2024-01-04 | 450.00 3 | 2 | 2024-01-03 | 300.00 2 | 1 | 2024-01-02 | 200.00 Explanation : The ORDER BY clause is used to sort numeric values in ascending or descending order. In the first query, the orders table is sorted by TotalAmount in ascending order. In the second query, the same table is sorted by TotalAmount in descending order.

Common aggregate functions include COUNT , SUM , AVG , MIN , and MAX . This section will guide you through the syntax and provide examples to help you understand how to use aggregate functions effectively. Syntax # The basic syntax for using aggregate functions in SQLite is as follows: SELECT aggregate_function(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition; aggregate_function : The aggregate function to be applied ( COUNT , SUM , AVG , MIN , MAX ). column_name : The name of the column on which the aggregate function is applied. table_name : The name of the table from which to retrieve data. condition : An optional condition to filter the rows before applying the aggregate function. Examples # COUNT # Input : SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users; Output : COUNT(*) --------- 3 Explanation : The COUNT function returns the number of rows in a table. In this example, it counts all rows in the users table. SUM # Input : SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) FROM orders; Output : SUM(TotalAmount) ---------------- 1100.0 Explanation : The SUM function returns the total sum of a numeric column. In this example, it calculates the total sum of the TotalAmount column in the orders table. AVG # Input : SELECT AVG(TotalAmount) FROM orders; Output : AVG(TotalAmount) ---------------- 275.0 Explanation : The AVG function returns the average value of a numeric column. In this example, it calculates the average value of the TotalAmount column in the orders table. MIN # Input : SELECT MIN(TotalAmount) FROM orders; Output : MIN(TotalAmount) ---------------- 150.0 Explanation : The MIN function returns the minimum value of a numeric column. In this example, it finds the minimum value of the TotalAmount column in the orders table. MAX # Input : SELECT MAX(TotalAmount) FROM orders; Output : MAX(TotalAmount) ---------------- 450.0 Explanation : The MAX function returns the maximum value of a numeric column. In this example, it finds the maximum value of the TotalAmount column in the orders table. Using Aggregate Functions with WHERE Clause # Input : SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE TotalAmount > 200; Output : COUNT(*) --------- 2 Explanation : Aggregate functions can be combined with the WHERE clause to filter rows before performing the calculation. In this example, it counts the number of orders where the TotalAmount is greater than 200. Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY # Input : SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID; Output : CustomerID | SUM(TotalAmount) -----------|----------------- 1 | 350.0 2 | 300.0 3 | 450.0 Explanation : The GROUP BY clause is used with aggregate functions to group the result set by one or more columns. In this example, it groups the orders by CustomerID and calculates the total sum of TotalAmount for each customer. Using HAVING Clause with Aggregate Functions # Input : SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING SUM(TotalAmount) > 300; Output : CustomerID | SUM(TotalAmount) -----------|----------------- 3 | 450.0 Explanation : The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on a condition involving aggregate functions. In this example, it groups the orders by CustomerID and selects only those groups where the total sum of TotalAmount is greater than 300. Workflow # To illustrate a typical workflow in using aggregate functions, let's go through a simple example: Create a Database : sqlite3 example.db Create Tables : CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); CREATE TABLE orders ( OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INTEGER, OrderDate DATETIME, TotalAmount REAL, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES users(id) ); Insert Data : INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'); INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com'); INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Bob Smith', 'bob.smith@example.com'); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, '2024-01-01', 150.00); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, '2024-01-02', 200.00); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (2, '2024-01-03', 300.00); INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (3, '2024-01-04', 450.00); Use Aggregate Functions : -- Count the number of users SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users; -- Calculate the total sum of TotalAmount in orders SELECT SUM(TotalAmount) FROM orders; -- Calculate the average TotalAmount in orders SELECT AVG(TotalAmount) FROM orders; -- Find the minimum TotalAmount in orders SELECT MIN(TotalAmount) FROM orders; -- Find the maximum TotalAmount in orders SELECT MAX(TotalAmount) FROM orders; -- Count the number of orders where TotalAmount is greater than 200 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE TotalAmount > 200; -- Group by CustomerID and calculate the total sum of TotalAmount for each customer SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID; -- Group by CustomerID and select only those groups where the total sum of TotalAmount is greater than 300 SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING SUM(TotalAmount) > 300; By mastering aggregate functions and their various usages, you can effectively perform calculations on multiple rows of data and derive meaningful insights from your SQLite database.

Joins are essential for querying data spread across multiple tables and are fundamental to relational database management. In this section, we will cover the four main types of joins: Inner Join : An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. It retrieves records that fulfill the join condition, ensuring that only the intersections of the datasets are included in the result set. This type of join is useful when you need to find records that exist in both tables. Left Join : A left join returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the right table. This type of join is helpful when you need to include all records from the left table, regardless of whether there is a matching record in the right table. Right Join : A right join returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the left table. This join is useful when you need to include all records from the right table, irrespective of whether there is a corresponding record in the left table. Full Join : A full join returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the table without a match. This join combines the results of both left and right joins and is beneficial when you need to retain all records from both tables, even if some records do not have corresponding matches in the other table. We'll use two tables, customers and orders , with no more than 10 records each to illustrate these joins. Tables for Examples # Customers Table : CREATE TABLE customers ( CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerName TEXT NOT NULL, ContactName TEXT, Country TEXT ); INSERT INTO customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES (1, 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders', 'Germany'), (2, 'Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados', 'Ana Trujillo', 'Mexico'), (3, 'Antonio Moreno Taquer\u00eda', 'Antonio Moreno', 'Mexico'), (4, 'Around the Horn', 'Thomas Hardy', 'UK'), (5, 'Berglunds snabbk\u00f6p', 'Christina Berglund', 'Sweden'), (6, 'Blauer See Delikatessen', 'Hanna Moos', 'Germany'); Orders Table : CREATE TABLE orders ( OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INTEGER, OrderDate TEXT, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES customers(CustomerID) ); INSERT INTO orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate) VALUES (10248, 1, '2024-07-04'), (10249, 2, '2024-07-05'), (10250, 3, '2024-07-06'), (10251, 4, '2024-07-07'), (10252, 5, '2024-07-08'), (10253, 7, '2024-07-09'), (10254, 8, '2024-07-10'); Inner Join # An inner join returns records that have matching values in both tables.

Customers Table : CREATE TABLE customers ( CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerName TEXT NOT NULL, ContactName TEXT, Country TEXT ); INSERT INTO customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES (1, 'Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders', 'Germany'), (2, 'Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados', 'Ana Trujillo', 'Mexico'), (3, 'Antonio Moreno Taquer\u00eda', 'Antonio Moreno', 'Mexico'), (4, 'Around the Horn', 'Thomas Hardy', 'UK'), (5, 'Berglunds snabbk\u00f6p', 'Christina Berglund', 'Sweden'), (6, 'Blauer See Delikatessen', 'Hanna Moos', 'Germany'); Orders Table : CREATE TABLE orders ( OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerID INTEGER, OrderDate TEXT, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES customers(CustomerID) ); INSERT INTO orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate) VALUES (10248, 1, '2024-07-04'), (10249, 2, '2024-07-05'), (10250, 3, '2024-07-06'), (10251, 4, '2024-07-07'), (10252, 5, '2024-07-08'), (10253, 7, '2024-07-09'), (10254, 8, '2024-07-10'); Inner Join # An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. Code : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Perform an inner join cursor.execute(''' SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderID FROM customers INNER JOIN orders ON customers.CustomerID = orders.CustomerID LIMIT 10; ''') # Fetch and print the results rows = cursor.fetchall() for row in rows: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() Explanation : This query selects the CustomerName from the customers table and the OrderID from the orders table where the CustomerID matches in both tables.

The result is NULL from the left side if there is no match. Note: SQLite does not support the RIGHT JOIN directly. Instead, you can achieve the functionality of a right join by reversing the table order and using a left join. Code : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Perform a right join (simulated with left join) cursor.execute(''' SELECT orders.OrderID, customers.CustomerName FROM orders LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID LIMIT 10; ''') # Fetch and print the results rows = cursor.fetchall() for row in rows: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() Explanation : This query selects the OrderID from the orders table and the CustomerName from the customers table, returning all orders and their corresponding customers. If an order does not have a matching customer, the CustomerName will be NULL .

The result is NULL from either side when there is no match. Note: SQLite does not support the FULL JOIN directly. Instead, you can achieve the functionality of a full join by combining the results of a left join and a right join using a UNION . Code : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Perform a full join (simulated with left join and union) cursor.execute(''' SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderID FROM customers LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.CustomerID = orders.CustomerID UNION SELECT customers.CustomerName, orders.OrderID FROM orders LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID LIMIT 10; ''') # Fetch and print the results rows = cursor.fetchall() for row in rows: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() Explanation : This query selects the CustomerName from the customers table and the OrderID from the orders table, performing a left join first and then a right join (by reversing the table order) to include all records from both tables.

Installing SQLite # Before we start using SQLite with Python, we need to ensure that SQLite is installed on your system. SQLite is included with Python\u2019s standard library, so you do not need to install any additional packages to use the sqlite3 module. You can verify if SQLite is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: sqlite3 --version If SQLite is not installed, you can download it from the official SQLite website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

This section will guide you through the fundamental operations such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating records, and deleting records using Python's sqlite3 module. Creating a Table # Creating a table in SQLite involves defining the table's schema, which includes the table name and the columns with their data types. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to an SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist) conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table named 'customers' cursor.execute(''' CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers ( CustomerID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, CustomerName TEXT NOT NULL, ContactName TEXT, Country TEXT ) ''') # Commit the changes conn.commit() # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we connect to an SQLite database named example.db , create a cursor object, and execute a CREATE TABLE statement to create a table named customers with four columns: CustomerID , CustomerName , ContactName , and Country . Inserting Data into a Table # Inserting data into a table involves using the INSERT INTO SQL command. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Insert data into the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('Alfreds Futterkiste', 'Maria Anders', 'Germany') ''') # Commit the changes conn.commit() # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we insert a new record into the customers table with the CustomerName 'Alfreds Futterkiste', ContactName 'Maria Anders', and Country 'Germany'. Querying Data from a Table # Querying data from a table involves using the SELECT SQL command to retrieve records that match specific criteria. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Query data from the 'customers' table cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM customers') # Fetch all rows from the executed query rows = cursor.fetchall() # Print the fetched rows for row in rows: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we retrieve all records from the customers table and print the results. Updating Data in a Table # Updating data in a table involves using the UPDATE SQL command to modify existing records. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Update data in the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' UPDATE customers SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt' WHERE CustomerName = 'Alfreds Futterkiste' ''') # Commit the changes conn.commit() # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we update the ContactName for the record where the CustomerName is 'Alfreds Futterkiste' to 'Alfred Schmidt'. Deleting Data from a Table # Deleting data from a table involves using the DELETE FROM SQL command to remove records that match specific criteria. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Delete data from the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' DELETE FROM customers WHERE CustomerName = 'Alfreds Futterkiste' ''') # Commit the changes conn.commit() # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we delete the record where the CustomerName is 'Alfreds Futterkiste'. Handling Errors # When working with databases, it's important to handle potential errors that may arise during database operations. The sqlite3 module provides exception classes that you can use to catch and handle these errors. Example : import sqlite3 try: # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Attempt to insert a record with a duplicate primary key cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES (1, 'Duplicate Customer', 'John Doe', 'USA') ''') # Commit the changes conn.commit() except sqlite3.IntegrityError as e: print('IntegrityError occurred:', e) except sqlite3.Error as e: print('SQLite error occurred:', e) finally: # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we attempt to insert a record with a duplicate primary key. The sqlite3.IntegrityError exception is caught and handled, printing an error message to the console.

In SQLite, a transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure that either all operations are completed successfully, or none of them are applied, maintaining the database's consistency. This section will guide you through the process of handling transactions in SQLite using Python's sqlite3 module. Understanding Transactions # A transaction has four key properties, commonly known as ACID properties: - Atomicity : Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; if one operation fails, the entire transaction fails. - Consistency : Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction. - Isolation : Ensures that the execution of one transaction is isolated from other transactions. - Durability : Ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure. Starting a Transaction # In SQLite, a transaction begins implicitly with the first SQL statement that modifies data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). However, you can also start a transaction explicitly using the BEGIN statement. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Begin a transaction cursor.execute('BEGIN') In this example, we explicitly start a transaction using the BEGIN statement. Committing a Transaction # Committing a transaction means making all changes made during the transaction permanent. This is done using the COMMIT statement. Example : import sqlite3 try: # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Begin a transaction cursor.execute('BEGIN') # Insert data into the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('New Customer', 'Jane Doe', 'USA') ''') # Commit the transaction conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as e: print('SQLite error occurred:', e) finally: # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we begin a transaction, insert a new record into the customers table, and commit the transaction using conn.commit() , making the changes permanent. Rolling Back a Transaction # Rolling back a transaction means undoing all changes made during the transaction. This is done using the ROLLBACK statement. Rolling back is useful when an error occurs, and you need to revert the database to its previous state. Example : import sqlite3 try: # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Begin a transaction cursor.execute('BEGIN') # Insert data into the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('New Customer', 'Jane Doe', 'USA') ''') # Simulate an error raise Exception('Simulated error') # Commit the transaction conn.commit() except Exception as e: print('Error occurred:', e) # Rollback the transaction conn.rollback() finally: # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we begin a transaction, insert a new record, and then simulate an error. The conn.rollback() statement reverts the database to its state before the transaction began. Using Context Managers for Transactions # Python's sqlite3 module supports using context managers ( with statements) to handle transactions. This approach simplifies transaction management by automatically committing or rolling back transactions. Example : import sqlite3 # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') try: with conn: # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Insert data into the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('New Customer', 'Jane Doe', 'USA') ''') except sqlite3.Error as e: print('SQLite error occurred:', e) finally: # Close the connection conn.close() In this example, using with conn: ensures that if an error occurs within the block, the transaction is automatically rolled back. If no error occurs, the transaction is committed when the block is exited. Savepoints # Savepoints allow you to set intermediate points within a transaction that you can roll back to without affecting the entire transaction. This is useful for complex transactions where you want to maintain finer control over what gets rolled back. Example : import sqlite3 try: # Connect to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') # Create a cursor object cursor = conn.cursor() # Begin a transaction cursor.execute('BEGIN') # Insert data into the 'customers' table cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('Customer One', 'John Doe', 'USA') ''') # Set a savepoint cursor.execute('SAVEPOINT sp1') # Insert another record cursor.execute(''' INSERT INTO customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Country) VALUES ('Customer Two', 'Alice Smith', 'UK') ''') # Rollback to the savepoint cursor.execute('ROLLBACK TO sp1') # Commit the transaction conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as e: print('SQLite error occurred:', e) finally: # Close the cursor and connection cursor.close() conn.close() In this example, we begin a transaction, insert a record, set a savepoint, insert another record, and then roll back to the savepoint.
