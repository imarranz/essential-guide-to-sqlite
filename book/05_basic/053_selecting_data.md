## Basic SQL Commands

### Selecting Data

Selecting data from tables is one of the most common operations in SQL, allowing you to retrieve specific records from your database. In SQLite, the `SELECT` statement is used to query data from one or more tables. This section will guide you through the syntax and provide examples to help you understand how to select data effectively.

#### Syntax

The basic syntax for selecting data from a table in SQLite is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ...
  FROM table_name
 WHERE condition
 ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];
```

- **column1_name, column2_name, ...**: The names of the columns you want to retrieve.

- **table_name**: The name of the table from which to retrieve the data.

- **condition**: An optional condition to filter the rows returned by the query.

- **ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]**: An optional clause to sort the results by one or more columns in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

#### Selecting All Columns

To select all columns from a table, use the asterisk (*) wildcard:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:

To select all columns from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

#### Selecting Specific Columns

To select specific columns from a table, list the column names separated by commas:

```sql
SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ...
FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:

To select the `name` and `email` columns from the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users;
```

#### Using the WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the rows returned by the query based on a condition:

```sql
SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ...
  FROM table_name
 WHERE condition;
```

**Example**:

To select all users with the name 'John Doe':

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

#### Using the ORDER BY Clause

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results of the query by one or more columns:

```sql
SELECT column1_name, column2_name, ...
  FROM table_name
 ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];
```

**Example**:

To select all users and order them by their name in ascending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;
```

#### Using Aggregate Functions

SQLite supports various aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to perform calculations on data:

```sql
SELECT aggregate_function(column_name)
  FROM table_name
 WHERE condition;
```

**Example**:

To count the number of users in the `users` table:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

To find the average price of products in the `products` table:

```sql
SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) FROM products;
```

#### Grouping Data with GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows:

```sql
SELECT column1_name, aggregate_function(column2_name)
  FROM table_name
 GROUP BY column1_name;
```

**Example**:

To find the number of orders placed by each customer:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID;
```

#### Filtering Groups with HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on a condition:

```sql
SELECT column1_name, aggregate_function(column2_name)
  FROM table_name
 GROUP BY column1_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Example**:

To find customers who have placed more than 5 orders:

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders
 GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

#### Joining Tables

To retrieve data from multiple tables, you can use various types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN):

```sql
SELECT table1.column1_name, table2.column2_name, ...
  FROM table1
  JOIN table2
       ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

**Example**:
To select order details along with product names:

```sql
SELECT od.OrderID, p.ProductName, od.Quantity, od.UnitPrice
  FROM "Order Details" od
  JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID;
```

#### Using Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested within another query. Subqueries can be used in various parts of the SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT column1_name
  FROM table_name
 WHERE column2_name = (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

**Example**:

To select all users who placed an order with a total amount greater than $1000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM orders WHERE total_amount > 1000);
```

#### Example Workflow

To illustrate a typical workflow in selecting data, let's go through a simple example:

* **Create a Database**:

```bash
sqlite3 example.db
```

* **Create Tables**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INTEGER,
    OrderDate DATETIME,
    TotalAmount REAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

* **Insert Data**:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com');

INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, '2024-01-01', 150.00);
INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (1, '2024-01-02', 200.00);
INSERT INTO orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount) VALUES (2, '2024-01-03', 300.00);
```

* **Select Data**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT name, email FROM users;
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE TotalAmount > 150;
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID;
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
SELECT o.OrderID, u.name, o.TotalAmount
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.CustomerID = u.id;
```

By mastering the `SELECT` statement and its various clauses, you can effectively retrieve and analyze data stored in your SQLite database. Selecting data is a fundamental operation that enables you to extract meaningful insights and perform data analysis.
