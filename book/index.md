SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. It is embedded in many applications, from browsers to mobile phones, and is highly suitable for data analysis tasks.

In this manual, we will explore the multifaceted features of SQLite, covering a wide range of functionalities that cater to the needs of developers and data analysts. Our guide will walk you through the different key areas.

This manual is designed to empower you with the knowledge and skills to effectively manipulate and analyze data using SQLite, turning raw data into valuable insights. Let's begin our journey into the world of data management with SQLite.

SQLite, being a cornerstone in the realm of embedded databases, has a wealth of resources and references available for those looking to delve deeper into its capabilities.
